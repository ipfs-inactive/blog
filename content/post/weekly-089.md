# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here’s what’s happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! 🚀


## Testground is here!
[Introducing Testground v0.5](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-06-launching-testground/), a tool dedicated to testing, simulating, benchmarking P2P and distributed systems at scale. This is a huge milestone for the distributed web, and for the wider p2p ecosystem. Discover what Testground is, how to get started, what’s coming next, and the backstory behind it on the IPFS blog.


## How do you use IPFS GUI Tools?
In order to help prioritize future improvements to IPFS tooling and interfaces, we’d appreciate learning more about how the IPFS Desktop app and the in-browser IPFS GUI (also known as Web UI) fit into your overall workflow. [This survey should take no more than 5 minutes](https://forms.gle/c6gHP1pVtwtRpzdP7), and will make a big difference—so thank you in advance for your time!

## Introducing the Hub
Last week, Textile Hub was released! The Hub is a collection of libraries and services connecting and extending IPFS, libp2p, and Filecoin so you can build apps, secure data, and delight users! [Learn all about the Hub on the Textile blog](https://blog.textile.io/announcing-the-textile-protocol-hub/). 

## The case for hosting Wikipedia on IPFS
The exploration to [host Wikipedia on IPFS](https://github.com/santhoshtr/wikipedia-ipfs) has begun. This project contains code to extract content from Wikipedia and add to IPFS and documentation of the proposed architecture. This is just a proof of concept and not ready for any serious use yet. As a reminder, a [wikipedia-ipfs mirror](https://github.com/ipfs/distributed-wikipedia-mirror) also currently exists.
