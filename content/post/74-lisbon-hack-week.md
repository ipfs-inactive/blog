In the week of May 21, 2018, we hosted another Hack Week in the sunny city of Lisbon.

The week was great for core developers, contributors and researchers to spend quality time together and work in a fast paced synchronous format towards solving concrete problems. It was incredible to see ideas and solutions flourishing for open problems we've been thinking for a while. The hacker spirit was strong throughout the entire week, culminating in a "Show Me What You Got" presentation to report back on decisions and demos.

The majority of discussions and collaborations were around IPFS, libp2p and applications built on top of them, but we also hosted a [CRDT Research meetup](https://blog.ipfs.io/67-crdt-research-meetup) on the second day - check out the video playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtTVkko1ZTn-qcGb-n6EqHff).

Didn't have a chance to attend? No worries, we got your back. Many of the report-back presentations were recorded so that you can learn about what got developed, designed and decided. We have compiled them into a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtR1hDEAKYXtUguNBkg2qceQ) for your viewing pleasure. You can see them all here:
