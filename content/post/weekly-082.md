# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here’s what’s happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! 🚀


## Using IPFS to fight COVID-19
Here are some ways people in the dweb space are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with their skills. 

* BOUNTY: [Create Collaborative Cluster for all CORD-19 datasets](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/1021)
* Tracking real-time COVID-19 & SARS-CoV-2 outbreak stats [over libp2p & IPFS](https://medium.com/temporal-cloud/real-time-covid-19-sars-cov-2-outbreak-stats-over-libp2p-ipfs-75972c9afa7) 
* NEWS: [InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Coronavirus News Fog](https://www.coindesk.com/interplanetary-file-system-is-uncensorable-during-coronavirus-news-fog) 
* NEWS: [A Chinese doctor posts a video about COVID-19 on IPFS after multiple takedowns on social media.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjmfvv/a_chinese_doctor_posts_a_video_about_covid19_on/) 
* **Want to jump in and help?** New projects are added daily to [Help with COVID-19](https://helpwithcovid.com/).

## People are building the coolest stuff with IPFS

* Introducing, the latest from Pinata, [IPFS Regions and Replications](https://medium.com/pinata/ipfs-regions-and-replications-a1e52d60dfdb)! Now Pinata allows you to replicate your content on multiple nodes and in multiple regions.

* [The Ceramic Protocol](https://medium.com/ceramic/introduction-to-the-ceramic-protocol-8d56951ae3f) from 3Box, is a new protocol that serves as a universal routing layer for storing decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, data schemas, policies for usage of web services, access control permissions, and other documents that collectively enable boundless interoperability between an ecosystem of connected wallets, applications, databases, and services.
* Learn [how to deploy a GatsbyJS site onto IPFS with Terminal](https://blog.terminal.co/posts/Gatsby-Terminal).
