# Welcome to the first IPFS Weekly of 2019! 🎉

For this first week back, we’ve put together a very special issue looking back on all that you, the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) community, accomplished in the last year. 

## 2018 was a year of significant milestones
  
**January:** Mozilla adds [support for Decentralization Protocols](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/) in popular web browser, Firefox.  
  
**February:** The world was introduced to [libp2p](https://blog.keep.network/introduction-to-libp2p-57ce6527babe), a peer-to-peer networking stack built modularly, with IPFS.  
  
**March:** [<code>js-ipfs v0.28.0</code>](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1228) was released, Juan Benet presented [Redecentralizing the Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeN_d4MpnNI) to MIT’s largest research lab, the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab, and <code>go-ipfs</code> released [version 0.4.14](https://blog.ipfs.io/34-go-ipfs-0.4.14).  
  
**April:** We introduced [IPFS Companion 2.2.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/35-ipfs-companion-2-2-0/) and gave folks a look at [<code>go-ipfs</code> on Windows](https://blog.ipfs.io/36-a-look-at-windows/).  
  
**May:** We announced the first ever [IPFSConf](https://twitter.com/IPFSbot/status/998964366077816832), Textile introduced [a personal IPFS](https://medium.com/textileio/your-photos-decentralized-and-encrypted-a-first-look-at-the-tech-inside-textile-photos-9b0155c25f15) that runs on your mobile device for true decentralized storage. [<code>js-ipfs 0.29.0</code> was released](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1320) and we closed out the month by getting the [IPFS Cluster 0.4.0 release candidates](https://twitter.com/hecturchi/status/1001074944481120256) out with a newly launched [IPFS Cluster website](https://cluster.ipfs.io/) to boot.
