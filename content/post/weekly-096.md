# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly!

A quick look back at what we accomplished together in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! 🚀

## April, a time for new beginnings 🛳

The [IPFS Mobile Design Research](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-10-ipfs-mobile-design-research/) project kicks off – an initiative to research existing P2P protocol use in mobile apps, and create an informed and research-backed set of design guidelines and best-practices for IPFS.

ProtoSchool explores the [Async Iterables returned by js-ipfs 0.41](https://school.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41e9e493c56c3865870435d91&id=d160d74ae0&e=28ddac0f86)

## Coming up next
So what’s next for IPFS? 🤔

If the first half of 2020 has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected! For now, we’re [looking forward](https://github.com/orgs/ipfs/projects/6) to implementing some pinning improvements, adding support for TypeScript, and providing even more opportunities to bring everyone all together. Stay tuned!
