If you've been following the many IPFS Camp updates here in the blog, you've likely already explored the videos from our [lightning talks](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#%EF%B8%8F-lightning-talks), [deep dives](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-deep-dives), [poster projects](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-poster-projects), [core and elective courses](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-core--elective-courses), and most recently [the SciFi Fair](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-sci-fi-fair). Today, we're excited to share the **Keynotes** that brought us together on our first and last days of IPFS Camp, and the **Community Interviews** that highlight some of the amazing work being done by IPFS Camp attendees in the wider ecosystem.

## Keynotes

We kicked off our time together with a [Welcome from David Dias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUE5vhZoavQ&feature=youtu.be) recapping the IPFS Project Mission, our community, and how we defined success for IPFS Camp. Want to know our full agenda for the weekend? Check out this great overview of the [InterPlanetary Space Training Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJvng8Z2W2I&feature=youtu.be) from David and all our content DRIs to index on everything IPFS Camp covered!

### Why IPFS? -- Juan Benet

Juan Benet, the original creator of IPFS, used [his keynote on "Why IPFS?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE_WSLbqqvo&feature=youtu.be) to help attendees zoom out to the wider context around our moment in time, how technology is evolving, and how IPFS fits into the bigger picture. He described the history of the internet, some potential predictions about the future, and how IPFS can address some major problems in the web as it exists today (notably censorship, inefficiency, and poor offline usability). Persistence, innovation, and determination are required to ensure we continue making progress for the long haul!

Want to learn about how the IPFS Community and Ecosystem have been growing? [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQnQbfhuBc&feature=youtu.be) from Molly Mackinlay, IPFS Project Lead, is a great overview of the scale, progress, and important milestones IPFS has achieved so far in 2019. IPFS-powered apps and tools now reach **millions of monthly end users**, and *hundreds of thousands of nodes* participate in the public IPFS network daily!

### Closing
On our last day, we celebrated the amazing learning, presentations, and courses with a [Space Training Program Graduation & Awards Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INVQPepMMMU&feature=youtu.be). Who got the award for best interactive skit? Watch this to see the team!

To close, Juan set us back out through the airlock back toward Earth with his [IPFS Camp Sendoff](https://youtu.be/HDc7kEYHang), including a huge **THANK YOU** to everyone who made this camp possible - especially the tireless Protocol Labs Events Team who worked so hard to make this event a huge success! üôèüëè

### Recap

Curious how everything fit together, or want to understand how the pieces of IPFS Camp became a greater whole? Check out [this overview from Molly](https://youtu.be/cQJXnJDbXv4) on how different components like the Poster Sessions & Deep Dives, SciFi Fair, Lightning Talks, and the Core & Elective Courses, wove together into a great community event. Many connections between different attendees and projects emerged from IPFS Camp too - spurring new collaborations and integrations. These great recaps from [Textile](https://medium.com/textileio/ipfs-camp-2019-the-highlights-and-takeaways-2b3cb4f42513), [Berty](https://berty.tech/blog/ipfs-camp/), and of course [the IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-07-08-ipfs-camp-recap/) highlight a few!

## Community Interviews
IPFS Camp was all about sharing and forming connections between projects and individuals in the IPFS community, so we managed to get some sit-down time with a few wonderful community members to talk about their projects.

In [this interview](https://youtu.be/wNfk05D887M), we heard from Edgar about how he's exploring distributing container layers through IPFS, and how it's changing his workflow at Netflix. His work on [p2plab](https://github.com/Netflix/p2plab) is already helping benchmark (and improve!!) IPFS throughput in reproducible and quantifiable ways.

We [spoke](https://youtu.be/3pSV6ai6QUI) to Hareesh from [Audius](https://audius.co/), a decentralized music streaming platform, about how they're using IPFS as their primary file storing system.
