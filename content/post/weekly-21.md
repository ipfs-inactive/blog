## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

+ The [HTTP client libraries are being renamed](https://blog.ipfs.io/58-http-client-rename/ )! The important news is that the HTTP client libraries are changing from `ipfs-api` to `ipfs-http-client`. True, it’s longer but way better at describing what the module is! Read the blog for more info. 
+ Look at [these amazing cookies](https://twitter.com/momack28/status/1069510119132516352) from @momack28’s holiday baking adventures. 😋
+ Don’t forget Sander Pick is presenting Textile photos at next week’s [IPFS Weekly Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#-ipfs-weekly-call--formerly-known-as-ipfs-all-hands-call), Monday at 5pm UTC. 

## Meet Yurko 👾

Last week, we mentioned [live-streaming over IPFS](https://github.com/tomeshnet/ipfs-live-streaming), and as it just so happens, at last week’s IPFS Weekly Call, Yurko was on hand to share it with us. Yurko is an IT native with two decades of experience and an active IPFS contributor. They are also a member of [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net/), a group of folks building a mesh network for, you guessed it, Toronto! To learn more about live-streaming over IPFS, [check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFsKl6UMwqM&feature=youtu.be&t=435) from last week’s meeting to see Yurko explain it.
