## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us in [chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.


## The latest

### v0.1 of the IPFS Explainer is now public!
After much hard work by [the IPFS Documentation Team](https://twitter.com/meiqimichelle/status/1172352640480530432), the A v0.1 explainer on how the IPFS content-addressed, peer-to-peer network works is finally here. [Check it out for yourself](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/how-ipfs-works/)!

### Join the js-ipfs Early Testers Programme
The early testers programme allows groups using js-ipfs in production to self-volunteer to help test js-ipfs release candidates to ensure that no regressions that might affect production systems make it into the final release. [Read on for more information](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/doc/EARLY_TESTERS.md).
