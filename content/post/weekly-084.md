## Celebrate Q1 in the IPFS Community
A quick look back at what we accomplished together in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! 🚀

## January! A new year 🎉

**The new IPFS Docs beta went live** 
IPFS now has documentation that is redesigned, with a simple, clean interface, has better navigation, and most importantly, reintroduced a key feature: the search functionality. [Read about it on the blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-01-07-ipfs-docs-beta/).

**Collaborative clusters are here**
The first set of [public collaborative clusters](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-01-09-collaborative-clusters/) and the first iteration of the clusters site went live this month. For full documentation on how to set up and operate clusters, see cluster.ipfs.io/documentation.

**go-ipfs 0.4.23 was released 🚢**
Just a small, [tidy patch release](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-01-30-go-ipfs-0-4-23/) with some critical fixes before 0.5.0 ships.

**ipfs-update got an update!**
Your favourite tool for updating go-ipfs got a [shiny new update](https://dist.ipfs.io/#ipfs-update) of its own. Windows users should like it a lot. 

## February! The plot thickens 🤔

**The Async Await Refactor and Other Big Refactors appear on the horizon**
Fortunately, we pulled together a migration guide, as well as several explainers as to [the changes coming](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-01-async-await-refactor/) and the [method for pulling them off](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-06-big-refactors/). 

**js-libp2p 0.27 released 🚢**
The Async Await refactor [lands first in js-libp2p](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-07-js-libp2p-0-27/).

**IPFS goes to Denver!**
First, the IPFS community gathered, courtesy of Cryptorado, for the first [Decentralized Networks Summit](http://dnsummit.cryptorado.org/) to share our learnings and use cases. If you missed it, you can check out the [captured live stream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG0dBSoDB1A&feature=youtu.be).

Second, several of our favorite collaborators and a few of the IPFS team made it to [ETHDenver](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-07-ethdenver-2020/), where approximately [half of the hackathon participants used IPFS](https://twitter.com/momack28/status/1230717064425328640), including 3 of the winners. 

**The IPFS Roadmap for 2020** 
[Content Routing becomes our North star](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-10-our-focus-for-2020/), but that’s not all! Plus, check out the awesome diagram of our ecosystem.

**js-ipfs 0.41.0 released 🚢**
The Async Await refactor finally [lands in js-ipfs internals](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-13-js-ipfs-0-41/), the result of a huge refactor, and cause for much celebration!

**Our collaboration with Netflix leads to new improvements to IPFS Bitswap**
Our mission—[a container distribution challenge Netflix wanted to address](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-14-improved-bitswap-for-container-distribution/)—how to efficiently pull container images in a large scale, multi-region environment. But how?

**Berty releases gomobile-ipfs 📱**
Finally, a library that aims to provide packages for Android, iOS, and React-Native that allow one to run and use an IPFS node on mobile devices. [Read the full announcement here](https://berty.tech/blog/go-mobile-ipfs).

**Textile ships Buckets: simple, dynamic data storage and management for IPFS**
[Built with IPFS and Threads](https://blog.textile.io/first-look-at-textile-buckets-dynamic-ipfs-folders/), Buckets provides users with simple to use, interoperable, and dynamic data folders shared over IPFS. Plus a few magical features. ✨

**Fission begins testing a Discourse IPFS Plugin**
Add [a Discourse forum plugin](https://talk.fission.codes/t/testing-discourse-ipfs-plugin/482) to use IPFS to store files, using the Fission web API.

**Temporal launches S3 ontop of IPFS**
This new functionality allows you to do things like stream video on IPFS, host a dynamic website, or even build an FTP server on top of IPFS. For a more complete list of endless possibilities, [check out the announcement](https://medium.com/temporal-cloud/introducing-s3x-endless-ipfs-dynamic-possibilities-stream-videos-host-dynamic-websites-f0072127070f).

## March! Rising to the challenge 💪

**Explore the anatomy of a CID in ProtoSchool’s latest tutorial** 
Also new, the snazzy icons and toggle which make it easy to find non-coding content on ProtoSchool, including the new multiple-choice [Anatomy of a CID tutorial](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-04-protoschool-tutorial-anatomy-of-a-cid/).

**Testground v.02 ships 🚢**
Learn all about Testground's goal of providing a set of tools for testing next generation P2P applications (i.e. Filecoin, IPFS, libp2p & others), as well as [their mission and roadmap](https://twitter.com/raulvk/status/1234934825448091664). 

**Qri shipped their biggest release ever!**
[qri-desktop 0.4.0 launches](https://github.com/qri-io/desktop/releases/tag/v0.4.0) a whole slew of new features & many bugs squashed. You can now browse, search, & clone datasets all within the app!

**The Unstoppable Extension goes live in the Chrome Browser**
[With their latest feature](https://twitter.com/unstoppableweb/status/1235604851603566592), you can surf the dweb in two simple steps!

**The effort to merge repos begins**
The js-ipfs team began trialing [a Lerna-style monorepo](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2877) to alleviate the confusion over the volume of repos necessary to pull in. It’s going to take some time, but it will be worth it. 😅

**IPFS Regions and Replications launched by Pinata**
For users looking for more speed and extra redundancy, Pinata now allows you to [replicate your content on multiple nodes and in multiple regions](https://medium.com/pinata/ipfs-regions-and-replications-a1e52d60dfdb). Making decentralization easier every day!

**Rust IPFS arrives on the scene** 
Active full-time work on a Rust-IPFS implementation has commenced, building on the great work from rust-libp2p. [Check out how you can contribute right here](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-18-announcing-rust-ipfs/)!

**And the very next day, Wolfram Lang support!**
Stephen Wolfram announces in [Version 12.1 of Wolfram Language & Mathematica](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/03/in-less-than-a-year-so-much-new-launching-version-12-1-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/) that support for external filesystems, specifically IPFS, was added. 

**Introducing the Ceramic Protocol**
Due to its [hybrid design relying on IPFS/IPLD](https://medium.com/ceramic/introduction-to-the-ceramic-protocol-8d56951ae3f) and various blockchains, Ceramic’s document graph is interoperable, scalable, permissionless, and low cost and we’re very excited about it.

**IPFS lands in Opera for Android**
As we recently mentioned, [IPFS landing, enabled by default, right out of the box](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-30-ipfs-in-opera-for-android/), in a production release of a major web browser was **a big deal** for us. 

**You can now host your Gatsby and Vue apps with IPFS**
Thanks to the hard work on some crucial plugins, you can now [host your Gatsby and Vue apps on IPFS](https://twitter.com/daviddias/status/1245199748849598470) easily with the path converter plugins. 


## Also new this quarter...
* The [IPFS DevGrants beta](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants) was successfully launched, resulting in 5 paid out bounties, 5 more in progress, and 6 grant approvals, most of which are still in progress. Discover how you can get paid to help build IPFS. ⚒
* We spent some time in Q1 doing a deep dive on where people are talking about IPFS and how we can reach and serve them better. You can learn more here about the Information Ecosystem Audit and its findings, [on our community repo](https://github.com/ipfs/community/tree/master/ecosystem-audit).
* [playwright-test](https://github.com/hugomrdias/playwright-test) now allows you to run Mocha, zora, Tape and Benchmark.js scripts inside real browsers

Next quarter we’ll have talks from Berty, EDGI, Unstoppable Domains, Anytype, Microsoft and more! Catch up on [this past quarter’s community calls here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSGRSHdU9dbsukHKlihZZAe), and we’ll see you on Monday!

## Great reads about IPFS from Q1 👇
* [IPFS Emerges as Tool to Distribute Container Images](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-management/ipfs-emerges-as-tool-to-distribute-container-images/): “contributors added a new way to fetch blocks to the Bitswap protocol that cut transfer time in half for benchmarked use cases around container distribution. In the previous version of Bitswap, it took on average 9.08 seconds to pull a 300 MiB image to 32 leeching peers. The optimized branch brought this down to 3.16 seconds—20% faster than DockerHub (3.93 seconds).” 
* [Decentralized Website, How to host a personal website on IPFS](https://lpfann.me/post/decentralized-site/): “IPFS introduced an address scheme for content and also the exchange of information using peer to peer networking without a central server. People using the IPFS application automatically act as servers for other peers when they have information another node needs.”
* [What’s IPFS and how it can change the Internet](https://medium.com/natix-io/whats-ipfs-and-how-it-can-change-internet-161239bc69ec): “IPFS is designed to fix HTTP problems and moves the internet towards the permanent web. A web that contents are stored permanently and no single entity controls or owns all of the data.”
* [How to deploy a Censorship Resistant Website for FREE](https://www.idiwork.com/how-to-deploy-a-censorship-resistant-website-forfree/): “I believe in free and open internet and to help keep it that we’re going to learn how to deploy a censorship-resistant static website in just a few minutes with a few free tools. To achieve censorship resistance we’re going to use IPFS (Interplanetary File System) a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, and data.”
* [IPFS and Docker](https://www.chevdor.com/post/2020-03-docker-ipfs/): “With IPFS, you can share files without the need for a centralized product such as Dropbox, Google Drive and Co. That means that you need no account, you have no size or bandwidth limits…​It makes sharing files convenient and very secure.”

## Coming up next in 2020
So what’s next for IPFS? Content Routing is still our major focus for 2020, if you recall [from the roadmap](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-10-our-focus-for-2020/), and we’re very motivated by the progress our team, as well as our contributor community, has made over the past few months. 

Much bigger things are right around the corner, but more about that later. We’ve also invested quite heavily in the IPFS ecosystem, having created these working groups: 

* **Browsers & Connectivity**: Maximize availability & connectivity of IPFS on the web
* **Collabs & Community**: Support IPFS users and grow new opportunities through research, collaborations and community engagement
* **Developer Experience & Maintainership**: Support the IPFS technical community through documentation, contributor experience, API ergonomics and tooling

The evidence of these groups’ progress is listed above, with much more in store this quarter. 😎
