_Welcome to the Sci-Fi Fair!_

Hot on the heels of IPFS Camp videos covering [lightning talks](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#%EF%B8%8F-lightning-talks), [deep dives](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-deep-dives), [poster projects](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-poster-projects) and [core + elective courses](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-core--elective-courses) come the **interviews from our [sci-fi fair](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-sci-fi-fair)**.

## The Sci-Fi Fair
In keeping with the fun and exploratory spirit of the camp, we put a twist on the usual conference demo area with our Sci-Fi Fair. We challenged our campers to bring their most surprising, experimental, interactive, scientific projects: in short, a vision of what the IPFS universe could look like in a future, or slightly askew, timeline.

See the complete-ish (we had quite a few guerilla participants!) [list of Fair projects](https://github.com/ipfs/camp/blob/master/SCI-FI_FAIR) for more details, or skip to the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtTWCyJcTgLFhsg8Bi2dFPCo) if you're impatient.

### Textile

_The Textile team demonstrates their interactive wares_

Long-time IPFS community members [Textile](https://textile.io) brought their crowd favorite p2p photobooth, as well as a game of cryptographically verified [Interplanetary Tag](https://medium.com/textileio/building-peer-to-peer-games-on-ipfs-a-look-at-interplanetary-tag-52d081ee1d32) (or arguably Interplanetary Assassin)

### RPi Cluster

_Hector explains the topology of the RPi cluster (feat. many blinkenlights)_

Hector and the rest of the [IPFS Cluster](https://cluster.ipfs.io) team came through with a project high in fun, fabric, and blinking lights: the Raspberry Pi IPFS Cluster. Six tiny but mighty (and lovingly upholstered) nodes tirelessly worked together to pin whatever CIDs were thrown at them and reported their pinset load through an ingenious hardware display. Not pictured: [@cluster-labs'](https://github.com/cluster-labs) [Horizon UI for IPFS Cluster](https://medium.com/towardsblockchain/we-made-a-dashboard-for-ipfs-clusters-and-now-we-want-you-to-check-it-out-a87234629908) giving fair attendees even more fine-grained insights into the pinset.

**BONUS:** If you like big IPFS nodes running on small computers (and/or "The IT Crowd"), you may also enjoy Alex's ["npm in a box"](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs), which packs the entire NPM package repository on a very portable (and pretty sleek looking) RPi based IPFS node with a BIG archival grade hard drive. Take this with you on your field trip and your team will never see an npm timeout ever again.

### MetaMask's Network Visualizer

The [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) crew brought a tool that proved invaluable in their network connectivity diagnostics: a DHT visualizer. Following some wireless network trouble (a real-world scenario to be sure), we were treated to some beautiful visualizations of network connectivity.

### And More
These are just some of the projects that made it to the Fair: head over to the [offical Fair playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtTWCyJcTgLFhsg8Bi2dFPCo) to catch the rest of the videos, as well as the full cuts of the interviews above. Don't miss Berty's Bluetooth Low Energy p2p transport, Brave's one-click in-browser IPFS, and more!

### Lest We Forget
Our tireless camera crew could only be in one place at a time (we're working on it), which has left some of our favorite projects sadly underdocumented in the video department. Here are some stills that fill in the gaps:

_Actyx's Rüdiger has somehow managed to avoid ALL photos at the fair, so here's a shot of him demoing their amazing industrial automation system from the lightning talks_

_Last but not least, Adin's "Fast IPNS" demo (it was VERY FAST!)_
