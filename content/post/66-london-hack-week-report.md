title: 2018 Q4 London Hack Week Summary
author: David Dias
---

The Go Core Dev Team for the IPFS, IPLD and libp2p projects spent some quality time together for a London Hack Week last quarter. The overall feeling was excitment, it was the first time that many of the core contributors got the chance to meet in person and learn what are the different goals the projects has, users needs and who is pushing for them. It was a great gathering and we wanted to make sure to share with you the results and the recordings.

The week format was really interesting and one that could almost go into the Async Team Management books (as a way to create sync time for distributed teams). A simplified overview of what happened is:

- **Monday** - Everyone spends time identifying priorities for the project and asserting them with the Project WG for how to prioritize with 2019 in mind.
- **Tuesday** - Ton of Hacking/Design discussions. Let the Hackers be free!
- **Wednesday** - OKRs check in. We went from a "top down" (few to many) OKR approach to a "divide and conquer" where 3 main areas of focus where identified (Data Exchange, Datastore & Providers) and the big go-ipfs team was divided into 3 groups that worked independently for 60 minutes to review and come up with fresh OKRs. These were so much better!
- **Thursday** - We had a [SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT ðŸ—¿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEUGPEVRDmU) session (links below) & hosted a [IPFS London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/london-ipfs/), more details on how the meetup went in a blog soonâ„¢.
- **Friday** - Final review of the OKRs. As a prize for our very successful week, we all went to the British Museum to check out the Rosetta stone among many other cool things.

In the end we ran Retrospective and asked "When is the next one! ðŸ˜„"

## IPFS London Meetup - Show & Tell

The fun would not be complete without an IPFS London Meetup with a selection of IPFS finest speakers and a surprise drive-by talk by Juan Benet himself, who hacked a thing while the meetup was happening. A post with the recorings will be published soon. Meanwhile, you can take a look at the pictures https://www.meetup.com/london-ipfs/photos/29361158/
