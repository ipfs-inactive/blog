# Welcome to IPFS Weekly #102

Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## Support for ipfs:// landed in Chromium’s protocol registry
Good news for integration of decentralized protocols in browsers! Now supported in Chromium: "cabal", "dat", "did", "dweb", "ethereum", "hyper", "ipfs", "ipns", and "ssb".  Another step forward for browser support and webcompat!

[Read more details](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/4e8ed0cecce04c5c55dd84a09e4df0d0f11c660f)

## HackFS pushes IPFS development forward
See all 134 projects built during HackFS in the showcase hosted by ETHGlobal. From building a way for content to persist on IPFS despite damage to data and the network at large to lowering the barriers to leveraging open data networks, and more, check out how what folks built with IPFS.

## Filecoin Launchpad applications due Friday, 8/28
The Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator is a fully-remote program dedicated to building more open, interoperable, and programmable tools, infrastructure, and apps for the distributed and decentralized web. The program runs Sep-Dec 2020, with 15-20 teams provided funding, mentorship, benefits, etc., culminating in a Demo Day and post-program fundraising support.
