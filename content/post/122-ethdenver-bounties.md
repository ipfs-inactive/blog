[ETHDenver 2021](https://www.ethdenver.com/) is in full swing, and as we mentioned in our [last post]( ) the IPFS community is very stoked to get to be a part of this unique and awesome event! To encourage folks to try IPFS for the first time, or the second time, or the forty-second time, we‚Äôve put together the following bounties to inspire your creativity and challenge your #BUILDathon skills. 

## IPFS Bounties for ETHDenver 2021
  
 * ü¶Å **Get Brave with IPFS**, $50: Using and demo‚Äôing IPFS in your project with Brave desktop browser, Resources: https://brave.com/ipfs-support/. 
 * ‚≠ïÔ∏è **Go browsing with Opera + IPFS**, $50: Using and demo‚Äôing IPFS in your project with Opera Android or Opera Touch on iOS, Resources: https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-30-ipfs-in-opera-for-android/

 * ü§ù **Collaboration**: Let IPFS coordinate the flow of data between you and your colleagues, even when working offline or on a local network.
 * üì¶ **Asset storage**: By storing small scripts or big databases of your project on IPFS, and depending on your architecture, you can yield several benefits.
 * üëæ **Gaming**: We want serverless online gaming, and we want it now!
 * üë∑ **IPFS as infrastructure**: Using IPFS allows you to abstract away a lot of the complexity of coordination between machines. No matter your architecture IPFS handles load balancing, de-duplication, caching, and high availability out-of-the-box.
 * ü•∑ **Decentralized identity**: Decentralized identity is a hot topic, and IPFS is one of the core technologies a lot of engineers build around.
 * üôè **Decentralizing the Web itself**: Some core pieces of the web are still centralized, making it more prone to break or being censored. IPFS can help and make the web more resilient.

If you have questions, please reach out at the IPFS Help Desk, located in the Spork Shill Zone, right next to the Textile booth. Our community will be happy to help you!
