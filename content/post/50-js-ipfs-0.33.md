All new Web UI - Check on your node stats, explore the IPLD powered Merkle forest, see peers around the world and manage your files, without needing to touch the CLI.

# 🔦 Highlights

## 🕹 Web UI 2.0

The IPFS Web UI has been given a HUGE revamp and is now 10x, no, 100x better than before! 😄

* **Check the status** of your node, it's Peer ID and connection info, the network traffic and the number of connected peers
* Easily **manage files** in your IPFS repo. You can drag and drop to add files, move and rename them, delete, share or download them
* You can **explore IPLD data** that underpins how IPFS works
* See all of your **connected peers**, geolocated by their IP address
* **Review the settings** for your IPFS node, and update them to better suit your needs

## 🛠 CID tool

A command line tool for converting, formatting and discovering properties of CIDs.

In the near future IPFS will be switching it's [**default** CID version for added content to version 1 and will use base 32 encoding for serialized CIDs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4143). This tool gives you the power to inspect and learn about CIDs as well as convert any CIDs you've been using from whatever base they're encoded in to a different base!
