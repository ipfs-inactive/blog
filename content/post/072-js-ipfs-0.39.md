> Configure your node with preset profiles! Limit outgoing browser requests! Start your node from fresh with one command!

# üî¶ Highlights

## üõ† Config profiles

IPFS now supports the `jsipfs config profile` subcommand which you can use to update your configuration with certain presets suited for different use cases.

You can examine available profiles with the `jsipfs config profile ls` command:

```console
$ jsipfs config profile ls
server:
 Recommended for nodes with public IPv4 address (servers, VPSes, etc.)...
local-discovery:
 Sets default values to fields affected by `server` profile...
test:
 Reduces external interference, useful for running ipfs in test environments...
default-networking:
 Restores default network settings. Inverse profile of the `test` profile.
lowpower:
 Reduces daemon overhead on the system. May affect node functionality...
default-power:
 Inverse of "lowpower" profile.
 ```

Apply them with `jsipfs config profile apply`:

 ```console
$ jsipfs config profile apply lowpower
... output shows the difference between the old config and the new
 ```

You will need to restart your daemon for changes to take effect.

Profiles can also be applied on init:

```console
$ jsipfs init --profile server
```

Or when starting the daemon (more on that in the 'Init and start' section below):

```console
$ jsipfs daemon --init-profile server
```

## üåê Concurrent HTTP requests limited in the browser

Interacting with IPFS can cause a lot of preloading and other background requests to be made - [most browsers](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=285567) can only have so many requests in flight to a single origin at once so this can cause requests to the same origins made outside of IPFS to take time as they wait their turn to be processed.

As of `ipfs@0.39.0`, the concurrency of HTTP requests for DNS resolution and preloading are limited to ensure there are always connections available to speedily process requests made by users.

## üåÖ Init and start your daemon in one command

When a new user first starts up the IPFS daemon they've been greeted by an unfriendly message telling them to `init` it first.

No longer!  Now on first startup, the daemon will auto-init its repo, removing a tiny bit of friction from getting on to the distributed web. üôå

## üöØ `block rm` now supported over the HTTP API

Previously this command only worked with the daemon turned off, now you can use the low level `jsipfs block rm` command with the daemon running.

N.b. it's rare that you would need to use this command, a more common approach would be to call `jsipfs repo gc` instead which removes all non-pinned blocks from your IPFS repo.

# üèó API Changes

* [`ipfs.config.profiles.list([options])`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/CONFIG.md#configprofileslist) has been added
* [`ipfs.config.profiles.apply(name, [options])`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/CONFIG.md#configprofilesapply) has been added
* [`ipfs.block.rm(cid, [options])`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/BLOCK.md#blockrm) now works over the HTTP API
