## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

### The 2019 IPFS Roadmap

Wondering what comes next for IPFS? Look no further than [the newly released 2019 IPFS Roadmap](https://blog.ipfs.io/78-ipfs-2019-roadmap/), shared earlier this month. Not only did we create a roadmap, but we also revised and clarified a mission statement and expanded some of the IPFS goals. We are very excited for the rest of 2019. 😊

### js-ipfs v0.35.0 RELEASED 🚀 

Last week, js-ipfs v0.35.0 was released, adding API changes and recursive DNS link loops, and decreasing approximately half of the bundle size of js-ipfs since v0.33! [Read the full blog announcement for all of the details](https://blog.ipfs.io/80-js-ipfs-0-35/).
