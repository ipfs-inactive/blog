Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## go-ipfs 0.7 is here 🚀🚀🚀
The latest iteration of the Go implementation of IPFS brings a truckload of features and fixes: SECIO disabled by default 👋, rotating keys 🔑, IPNS paths now encode the key name as a base36 CIDv1 by default 🎹, key export/import 📦, and more. Great work everyone!

## Case Study: Shipping IPFS with Morpheus.Network 
And we mean that quite literally. For Morpheus.Network, shipping of goods across the globe, it’s critical—both functionally and legally—to have verifiable, consistently accessible documentation for every shipment. That’s where IPFS comes into the picture, in the latest entry in the IPFS Case Study series.

## Space Race 2: Slingshot - put your project on Filecoin for FIL token rewards!
[Slingshot](https://slingshot.filecoin.io/) has kicked off and there’s still time to join the fun!
