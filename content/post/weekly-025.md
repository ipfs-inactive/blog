## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.


## Announcing ProtoSchool

This week we’re excited to announce the launch of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school/), an educational community that teaches decentralized web protocols and tools through online tutorials and local chapter events.

[Self-guided interactive tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials) teach new concepts through code challenges completed in the browser, with feedback to help you track your progress. Tutorials are built by community members like you with an interest in helping others learn about IPFS and other decentralized web projects such as IPLD, LibP2P, Multiformats, and Filecoin.

[Local chapter events](https://proto.school/#/chapters) around the world use ProtoSchool tutorials as curriculum, with mentors available to help participants work through the challenges. ProtoSchool chapters operate independently, but each has its own repo in our org to facilitate chapter discussions and event planning, as well as easy hosting of a chapter website via GitHub Pages. [Start your own chapter today!](https://proto.school/#/host) Check out our [launch video](https://youtu.be/G5aiLkHZ7CM) to learn more about how you can get involved with the ProtoSchool community.


## Meet Jordyn Bonds and Mark Henderson of TallyLab

At next week’s IPFS Weekly Call, creators of [TallyLab](https://tallylab.com/), Jordyn Bonds and Mark Henderson will be on hand to explain how they used IPFS to help them build the encrypted diary app. Besides being CTO for TallyLab, Mark is also Distributed Systems Engineer at Haja Networks (working on OrbitDB) and is an active IPFS contributor. On the side, he makes podcasts and runs a marine science hackathon. Jordyn is TallyLab’s CEO – which, on any given day can mean building the UI, talking to customers, bookkeeping, or anything else under the sun. On the side, she is an instructor for Girls Who Code and throws a monthly karaoke party out of her living room. See their presentation next Monday at 5pm UTC [here](
