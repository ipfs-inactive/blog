## Storing NFTs on IPFS!
Learn best practices for addressing and storing data for NFTs using IPFS, for NFTs that stand the test of time. Permanence and immutability are part of the core value proposition of a non-fungible token (NFT). Unfortunately, many NFTs being targeted at consumers today offer neither of these properties due to fundamental design flaws. IPFS can help address these concerns, and NFTs that leverage IPFS gain several advantages. [Read our recent blog post](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-04-05-storing-nfts-on-ipfs/) about storing your NFT on IPFS and find more details on the IPFS documentation site, in our new article [Best Practices for Storing NFT Data using IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/best-practices-for-nft-data/).

## ResNetLab On Tour is going On Demand!
Today we are thrilled to announce that ResNetLab on Tour is going On Demand! The program originally launched in 2019 as an initiative to onboard the academic community to the IPFS architecture. We have been to more than 10 academic conferences and university labs presenting 4hr-long tutorials to experts in the area of networks. As of today, we are making these resources available to everyone! Take a look for yourself and head on over to the [shiny new ResNetLab on Tour website](https://research.protocol.ai/tutorials/resnetlab-on-tour/) for all the material and extra pointers!
