# Welcome to IPFS Weekly #99

Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## Join APOLLO and the Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator 🚀
Recently, Filecoin Ignite announced two new initiatives to get folks excited and hacking on the decentralized web. APOLLO is a 6-week, invite-only program designed for makers interested in the Filecoin ecosystem to either continue their work or start new projects using Filecoin and Web3 ecosystem. The Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator is a full-time, fully-remote program, built-in collaboration with Tachyon, looking for startups building more open, interoperable, and programmable tools, infrastructure, and applications for the distributed web.

## Quote of the week
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To truly own your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/data?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#data</a> I understand you need access and availability, does that mean you will basically own your private cloud with tools like <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPFS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IPFS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/filecoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#filecoins</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Filecoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Filecoin</a> ? If so it seems to become a Great alternative to exisiting cloud storage systems like <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a></p>&mdash; Ronny Boesing (@BoesingRonny) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoesingRonny/status/1288057780449026048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2020</a></blockquote>
