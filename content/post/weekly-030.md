## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. üëã

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that‚Äôs a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we‚Äôre up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

+ [IPDR: InterPlanetary Docker Registry](https://github.com/miguelmota/ipdr) is a Docker Registry tool that proxies Docker registry requests to IPFS for pushing and pulling images. IPDR allows you to store Docker images on IPFS instead of a central registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.


## Meet Cale Teeter

Next week, [Cale Teeter](https://github.com/caleteeter), Senior Software Blockchain Engineer at Azure will be joining the IPFS Weekly Call to talk about ‚ÄúIPFS in the Enterprise.‚Äù Enterprise consortiums have been asking for the option of decentralized storage to complement the solutions they are building. Microsoft built on the private options made available, to make it easy for companies to create these networks. Cale is also one of the hosts of [‚ÄúThe Azure Podcast.‚Äù](http://azpodcast.azurewebsites.net/) Meet Cale at the [IPFS Weekly Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#-ipfs-weekly-call--formerly-known-as-ipfs-all-hands-call) next Monday at 5pm UTC.
