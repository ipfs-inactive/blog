There's a new version of the [ipld-explorer-cli](http://npm.im/ipld-explorer-cli) tool for exploring [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) data! Let's break down those acronyms and explain why I'm so excited about this.

[IPLD (Inter Planetary Linked Data)](https://ipld.io/) is the underlying data structure used by IPFS that allows it to store, retrieve and traverse through any type of content-addressed data. Recently, our team created the awesome new [IPLD Explorer](https://explore.ipld.io) so you can visually explore IPLD objects. If you haven't already checked it out, hop over and explore everything from [git repos](https://explore.ipld.io/#/explore/z8mWaJHXieAVxxLagBpdaNWFEBKVWmMiE) to [ethereum blocks](https://explore.ipld.io/#/explore/z43AaGEvwdfzjrCZ3Sq7DKxdDHrwoaPQDtqF4jfdkNEVTiqGVFW) to [historic photo archives of the lunar landings](https://explore.ipld.io/#/explore/QmSnuWmxptJZdLJpKRarxBMS2Ju2oANVrgbr2xWbie9b2D) to your own IPLD data. 

The IPLD Explorer also comes with a command-line interface ([ipld-explorer-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-explorer-cli)) so you can explore with your keyboard. I was inspired to give it an upgrade so that it could resolve IPLD formats other than `dag-pb` and `dag-cbor`, like `git-raw` and `ethereum-block`. It also now works with a `js-ipfs` daemon if you have one running (you’ll need to update the API address using the "config" command).

Here's a quick demo video:

### Installing and using the new CLI

Ensure you have at least:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Install the module globally:

```
$ npm i -g ipld-explorer-cli
```

Then, launch the interactive shell:

```
$ ipld-explorer
```

You'll see instructions to explore sample datasets and begin traversing the Merkle forest 🌲🌲🌲. You can also start a [js-ipfs daemon](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#ipfs-daemon) to explore your own data. Enjoy!
