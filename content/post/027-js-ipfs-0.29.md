# 🔦 Highlights

### 🏎 Bitswap is 30% faster

Bitswap is now 30%, thanks to fixing a bug on [js-ipfs-bitswap](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/175#issuecomment-390957244) that was causing every message to be sent individually.

### 👓 js-ipfs now works with uglify-es just fine

The duck typing throughout js-ipfs has been improved and that means that now you can use uglify-es again to minify your js-ipfs code. The result is that the js-ipfs bundled version is now back to its minified size as well. 

### ☎️ Circuit Relay was merged in

Circuit Relay enables connectivity between any two nodes through a third relay node. This ensures connectivity in almost every scenario, that is, as long as peers can connect to some public IP node. Learn how to use it [here](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples/circuit-relaying). This was one of the two features that js-ipfs was missing to get full connectivity.

### 🗑 S3 backend for IPFS

Ever wished you could use an external storage backend to store all your IPFS blocks? Now you do and we got a tutorial for you! See how to configure a repo at https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples/custom-ipfs-repo and if you want to learn how to use S3 as your external backend, then consult https://github.com/ipfs/js-datastore-s3/tree/master/examples/full-s3-repo.

### 📜 README Overhaul 

The js-ipfs README keeps improving, now with 40% more information about the multiple arguments you can pass to IPFS. Read all the options at https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#api

### 🎷 Project Tracking

If you haven't already, I welcome you to check how the js-ipfs team tracks their work at https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/MGMT.md. It is fun to see the issues fly through the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/ipfs/js-waffle).

### ✅ Config validation and config reuse fix

In addition to better documentation on how to configure your node, you now get some config validation in case you mistype something. Also as a bonus, you can now spin multiple nodes in the same process without them getting confused and using the same config.

### 📖 interface-ipfs-core keeps getting more API calls documented and tested

Make yourself familiar with the IPFS Core API at https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/tree/master/SPEC. New additions include files.add --wrapWithDirectory, --onlyHash and others.

### 📊 Bandwidth stats now available

Bandwidth statistics for your IPFS node from the `libp2p` layer are now exposed and available to query for the whole node, per peer or per protocol. You can also use Node streams or pull streams to get a continuous feed of that tasty statistical juice.

### 📡 Fully Async PubSub API

The PubSub API has been updated to expose Async calls (with Callbacks and Promises). This was necessary as some nodes exist behind an HTTP API and using a fake sync API would create race conditions. Make sure to update your use of PubSub, you can see the API changes below. 

### 🛎 Ping API implemented

JS IPFS now has API calls for pinging other peers. Fun fact, this was actually the first thing a js-ipfs node did, but it got lost in a massive refactor and now it is back and not only in js-ipfs core, it is also available through the CLI and HTTP API

### ⚛️ Electron Main Process support with Electron 2.0

As a good surprise, Electron 2.0 has better support for Native Modules and with that, js-ipfs can run on the Main process mode. This concludes the [full support for IPFS in electron](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/256).

# 🏗 API Changes

1. Argument order for `pubsub.subscribe` has changed:
    * Old: `pubsub.subscribe(topic, [options], handler, [callback]): Promise`
    * New: `pubsub.subscribe(topic, handler, [options], [callback]): Promise`
2. The `pubsub.unsubscribe` method has become async meaning that it now takes a callback or returns a promise:
    * Old: `pubsub.unsubscribe(topic, handler): undefined`
    * New: `pubsub.unsubscribe(topic, handler, [callback]): Promise`
3. Property names on response objects for `ping` are now lowered:
    * Old: `{ Success, Time, Text }`
    * New: `{ success, time, text }`
4. In the CLI, `jsipfs object data` no longer returns a newline after the end of the returned data
