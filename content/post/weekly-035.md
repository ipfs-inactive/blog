## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.


## The latest

### Introducing the new IPFS Desktop

With the 0.7.1 release of the IPFS Desktop, we now have one simple interface! This is a pre-release, so check out [all of the details in the changelog](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/tag/v0.7.1) and if you find bugs or have some feedback, [drop a line here](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/new).

### Curious about CRDTs?

We <3 Conflict-free Replicated Data Types so much so that last April we hosted the [2018 CRDT Research Meetup](https://blog.ipfs.io/67-crdt-research-meetup/) in Lisbon. Authors of the CRDT research literature and representatives from the Labs it originated were in attendance, and some gave talks that you can watch the videos for by following [this link!](https://blog.ipfs.io/67-crdt-research-meetup/)

### Revisiting IPFS Hack Week in Lisbon

Last spring IPFS held a [Hack Week in Lisbon](https://blog.ipfs.io/74-lisbon-hack-week/) to bring together core developers, contributors, researchers, and IPFS community members to sync, hang, and work on some problem solving together IRL. If you missed it, many of the presentations were recorded so you can watch [those videos here](https://blog.ipfs.io/74-lisbon-hack-week/). If you’re interested in attending the next IPFS Community event, check out IPFS Camp (more details below) and get [registered here](https://camp.ipfs.io/).


## Meet Jia Le Dai

[Jiale Dai](https://twitter.com/daijiale6239) used to work on mapping applications as a backend engineer at Baidu. In 2017 he became interested in IPFS, libp2p, and multiformats. Jiale eventually started organizing [IPFS meetups for Chinese developers and enthusiasts](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NrvZo5_hLD_CIXpZFPARbg). His goal is to get more Chinese developers interested in distributed web technologies like IPFS. Jiale joins the [IPFS Weekly Call next Monday at 5pm UTC](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#-ipfs-weekly-call--formerly-known-as-ipfs-all-hands-call) to present on IPFS in China.
