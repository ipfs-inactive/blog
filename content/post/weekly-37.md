title: Recapping IPFS in Q1 2019 üéâ
author: Jenn Turner
---

We‚Äôve put together a very special issue looking back on all that you, [the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) community, accomplished so far, in 2019. From milestones like releases, projects like ProtoSchool, to the many new (and awesome) contributors who have joined us, and what‚Äôs to come for the rest of this year, we hope you enjoy this quarterly recap. 

Thanks for being part of our community, we truly couldn‚Äôt make IPFS what is without you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Milestones

*As far as shipping goes, yeah we did that.*

### Introducing ProtoSchool

In January, we announced [the ProtoSchool project](https://blog.ipfs.io/63-ipfs-weekly-25/), aimed at bringing education teaching decentralized web protocols and tools through online tutorials and local chapter events to folks across the web. So far there are SIXTEEN chapters worldwide! 

### js-ipfs 0.34.0 released

[This release of the JavaScript implementation of IPFS](https://blog.ipfs.io/64-js-ipfs-0-34/) has it all: reading Protobuf DAG nodes became super fast, adding content became ‚Äúblazingly‚Äù fast, HAMT support was added to MFS, added IPNS over pubsub and DHT, plus dep upgrades, API changes and more!

### ipfs.io has implementations *and* integrations now
Speaking of *implementations* [the official IPFS website](https://ipfs.io/#implementations) received a whole section devoted to both the current implementations (JavaScript and Go), plus some cool integrations, like our browser companion.

### Announcing the 1st ever üåå IPFS Camp

We hope you join us for [a three day hacker retreat for the builders of the Distributed Web](https://blog.ipfs.io/72-ann-ipfs-camp/) that will happen between June 27th to 30th, also known as the first ever [IPFS Camp](https://camp.ipfs.io/)! Register now to join us.

### üéâgo-ipfs 0.4.19 arrivedüéâ

The Go implementation of IPFS also got some love this quarter, with a new release in March. [Version 0.4.19](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.4.19) includes NEW features like file listing and initializing with random ports, reliabilility and perf improvements, plus a pretty significant refactor of CoreAPI. 

### The ‚ú®new‚ú® IPFS Desktop

Springtime also saw [a new release of the IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/tag/v0.7.1), which, in case you missed it, is the [menubar app](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop) that allows you to access IPFS straight from the desktop instead of having to deal with that command line business. Check it out!

## Coming up in 2019

In case you missed it, we recently presented [The 2019 IPFS Roadmap](https://blog.ipfs.io/78-ipfs-2019-roadmap/), which introduces a brand new mission statement, as well as 16 goals for the project. Discover those goals plus the 2019 Epics (what does *that* mean?) in [Achievement Unlocked: The 2019 IPFS Roadmap!](https://blog.ipfs.io/78-ipfs-2019-roadmap/)

We would also be remiss if we didn‚Äôt share that ENS + IPFS are coming to [the Brave browser!](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1105565560224563202) Very exciting stuff for the start of 2019.
