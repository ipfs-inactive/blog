# Welcome to the first IPFS Weekly of 2019! üéâ

For this first week back, we‚Äôve put together a very special issue looking back on all that you, the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) community, accomplished in the last year. 

## 2018 was a year of significant milestones
  
**January:** Mozilla adds [support for Decentralization Protocols](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/) in popular web browser, Firefox.  
  
**February:** The world was introduced to [libp2p](https://blog.keep.network/introduction-to-libp2p-57ce6527babe), a peer-to-peer networking stack built modularly, with IPFS.  
  
**March:** [<code>js-ipfs v0.28.0</code>](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1228) was released, Juan Benet presented [Redecentralizing the Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeN_d4MpnNI) to MIT‚Äôs largest research lab, the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab, and <code>go-ipfs</code> released [version 0.4.14](https://blog.ipfs.io/34-go-ipfs-0.4.14).  
  
**April:** We introduced [IPFS Companion 2.2.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/35-ipfs-companion-2-2-0/) and gave folks a look at [<code>go-ipfs</code> on Windows](https://blog.ipfs.io/36-a-look-at-windows/).
