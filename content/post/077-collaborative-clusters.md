title: Announcing collaborative clusters
author: Hector Sanjuan

We are very excited to announce the first set of public *collaborative
clusters* and the first iteration of the
[collaborative clusters website](https://collab.ipfscluster.io).

*Collaborative clusters* are an easy way to join and help improving distribution
and data availability of specific datasets in the IPFS Network.

Using IPFS Cluster's
[latest release (0.12.1)](https://cluster.ipfs.io/news/0.12.0_release/) we
have set up the first of those archives:

* Filecoin cluster: which will be used to pin Filecoin parameters and
  Filecoin objects.
* Spanish books from the Gutenberg Project: a collection of Spanish literature
  from the [Gutenberg Project](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
* IPFS Websites: a list with a few of the IPFS-universe websites (such as ipfs.io, libp2p.io).

Users can join these clusters by running a single `ipfs-cluster-follow`
command. You will need to have enough space available in your IPFS repository
(check the size row for each cluster on the
[website](https://collab.ipfscluster.io)).

Instructions on how to setup and join these and, in the future, other
collaborative clusters can be found at
[https://collab.ipfscluster.io](https://collab.ipfscluster.io). You can stop
and re-start replication whenever you want. Also, here's a quick video to show
how easy it is:

We hope that collaborative clusters will allow the community to participate in
the distribution and seeding of data they care about, enabling easy "mirroring"
on the IPFS network, along with unlocking *Content-Distribution-Network (CDN)*
properties.

## Creating your own Clusters

Collaborative clusters are no different from normal IPFS Clusters, with the exception that
they include a list of *trusted peers* (peers that can modify the cluster pinset).

The process of setting up one of these and letting other peers easily join as
followers is documented at
[https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation/collaborative/](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation/collaborative/).

## About the IPFS Cluster project

The [IPFS Cluster project](https://cluster.ipfs.io) provides data
orchestration across a swarm of IPFS daemons by allocating, replicating and
tracking a global pinset distributed among multiple peers.

For full documentation on how to setup and operate clusters, see
[https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation).
