# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! üöÄ

## ProtoSchool explores the Async Iterables returned by js-ipfs 0.41
The recent release of js-ipfs 0.41 introduced a huge async/await refactor, and the breaking changes were no joke! The affected ProtoSchool tutorials have been updated to reflect the recent changes, highlighting which js-ipfs methods now return Async Iterables and how you can use /for await‚Ä¶of/ loops or alternative helper modules to work with them.

Check out the updated content in our [Mutable File System (MFS)](https://school.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41e9e493c56c3865870435d91&id=d160d74ae0&e=28ddac0f86) and [Regular Files API tutorials](https://school.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=41e9e493c56c3865870435d91&id=b1b4d385be&e=28ddac0f86), then check out the updated event submission process for local leaders to list virtual workshops on ProtoSchool‚Äôs [events page](https://proto.school/#/events)!

## Using IPFS to fight COVID-19
Here is a followup to our bounty for creating a CORD-19 dataset:

We now have a **CORD-19 collaborative cluster dataset**, but it won‚Äôt be useful if the people that should use it don‚Äôt know that they can access this content from the IPFS network! 

Please share it freely: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme2F949GSfupReGPMKJ4EQTGi9hzzUcsJvRS1Mr8YVNzQ


## Meet Fleek
