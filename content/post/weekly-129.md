Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Congratulations ION for launching v1.0!
We‚Äôre so excited to see a new decentralized identity service launch which stores its data on IPFS. We‚Äôve been working with ION to support their use of IPFS since 2019. IPFS comes into the picture at the storage layer, where ION aggregates transactions into batches, adds those batches to IPFS, and then writes the IPFS content identifier (CID) of the batch to the blockchain. Try ION v1.0 today and share your feedback in the [ION repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion) or let [@IPFS know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ipfs).

## IPFS & Friends at Chainlink Spring Hackathon! 
Last week the [Chainlink Hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon) hosted Dietrich Ayala from Protocol Labs and Textile's Andrew Hill for some amazing tutorials and talks about building on IPFS. [Andrew‚Äôs presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSdsTsh0QI&feature=emb_logo) included a workshop featuring Buckets, an introduction to Powergate as well as the Miner Index. And be sure to check out [Dietrich‚Äôs talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds1RJplxxxo) for an overview of IPFS, its users, how to start up a IPFS Space Daemon or command line interface, the various IPFS software integrations, and resources that will guide you through building on the IPFS ecosystem.
