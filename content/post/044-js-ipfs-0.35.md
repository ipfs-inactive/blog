# üî¶ Highlights

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Huge bundle size cuts!

One of the biggest goals for JS IPFS is to enable the distributed web in the browser. Part of that is being a good web citizen and minimising the amount of code we ship, to ensure IPFS downloads quicker, `npm install`'s quicker, loads quicker and utilizes fewer resources. It's especially important on resource constrained mobiles and IoT devices.

The good news you want to hear is that we've now chopped around **50%** off the bundle size of JS IPFS since 0.33, that's a reduction of nearly _half_ of the code we were previously shipping! This is an amazing improvement and a great reason to upgrade.

## üå≥ DAG HTTP API

The HTTP API now has endpoints for DAG operations like `get`, `put` and `resolve`. Hooray! It was actually super easy so we just decided to do it spontaneously. I know, we're so zany.

On a more serious note, this brings JS IPFS another step closer to feature parity with Go IPFS. We're pushing forwards with this in _every_ release üöÄ - stay tuned!

## üôâ Multiple address listening for API and Gateway servers

The HTTP API and the HTTP Gateway started by your IPFS node can now listen on multiple addresses. It's a backward compatible change, all you have to do is change the value of `Addresses.API` or `Addresses.Gateway` in your JSON config file to be an _array_ of [multiaddrs](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/) instead of a single string multiaddr. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "Addresses": {
    "API": [
      "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001",
      "/ip6/::1/tcp/5002"
    ],
    "Gateway": [
      "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080",
      "/ip6/::1/tcp/8080"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üî≠ Recursive DNS link lookups

[DNS link](http://dnslink.io/) TXT records like `dnslink=/ipns/domain.com` can now be recursively resolved until they hit an IPFS hash like `/ipfs/QmHash`. Even better, that's the new default. üëå

# üèó API Changes

* CLI
    * The global flag `--local` was renamed to `--offline`
    * Added flag `--enable-preload` to `jsipfs daemon` command to allow users to enable or disable content preloading
* Core
    * `ipfs.util.isIPFS` and `ipfs.util.crypto` have moved to static exports and should now be accessed like:

        ```js
        const { isIPFS, crypto } = require('ipfs')
        ```
    * `ipfs.types.*` have moved to static exports and should now be accessed like:

        ```js
        const { Buffer, CID, multiaddr, multibase, multihash, PeerId, PeerInfo } = require('ipfs')
        ```
    * `ipfs.resolve` now supports resolving to the middle of an IPLD block instead of erroring. Given:

        ```js
        b = {"c": "some value"}
        a = {"b": {"/": cidOf(b) }}
        ```
        `ipfs resolve /ipld/cidOf(a)/b/c` should return `/ipld/cidOf(b)/c`. That is, it resolves the path as much as it can. Previously it would simply fail with an error.
    * `ipfs.dns` now resolves recursively by default, set the `recursive` options to `false` to prevent this behaviour
* HTTP API
    * Added the following DAG endpoints:
      * `/api/v0/dag/put`
      * `/api/v0/dag/get`
      * `/api/v0/dag/resolve`
