## Mint an NFT with IPFS!  
Dive into the details of NFT minting with IPFS and Ethereum with the brand new guide [Mint an NFT with IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/mint-nfts-with-ipfs) on the docs site. In this tutorial, you‚Äôll get to know Minty, a simple tool that creates IPFS-backed non-fungible tokens on Ethereum. [In this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNukgBtlWeU&feature=youtu.be), Yusef from Protocol Labs shows how (and why!) to store NFT assets and metadata on IPFS and how to link that data to an on-chain token. If the code overview in the video has you wanting more, the [Minty repo](https://github.com/yusefnapora/minty) is waiting for you to clone it and play around!
