## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us in [chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.


## The latest

### IPFS Camp course videos released 🍿

If you’ve been following the updates from IPFS Camp you’ve likely already explored the videos from the lightning talks, deep dives, and poster projects, but now the videos from [IPFS Camp’s core and elective courses have been released](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-09-18-ipfs-camp-course-videos/)!

### IPFS Cluster v0.11.0 is out!

[IPFS Cluster v0.11.0 is the biggest release in the project’s history](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Its main feature is the introduction of the new CRDT “consensus” component. Leveraging Pubsub, Bitswap and the DHT and using CRDTs, cluster peers can track the global pinset without needing to be online or worrying about the rest of the peers as it happens with the original Raft approach. Be sure to check out [the updated documentation too](https://cluster.ipfs.io/documentation/).
