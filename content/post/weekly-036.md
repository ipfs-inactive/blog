## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

### Initial draft of an introspection data model for libp2p
Late last week, @raulk posted an initial draft of thoughts and ideas for the libp2p network visualizer [{Phantom}Drift](https://github.com/libp2p/notes/pull/9/files). Take a look and give some constructive criticism if you have it.
