## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

### As promised, js-ipfs 0.37.0 has been released
The latest release of js-ipfs introduces a brand new constructor, better DNSLink support and delegated routing! [See the IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-06-js-ipfs-0-37/) for the full release details. 

### js-libp2p adds Gossipsub support and Promisify API
The folks working on Libp2p have been busy too! Last week, they announced the release of [js-libp2p version 0.26.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-07-js-libp2p-0-26/) which adds support for a more efficient pubsub router (Gossipsub) and Promisify for the time being. Check it out!

### Hello ipfs-cohost 👋
Created by @olizilla, [ipfs-cohost](https://github.com/olizilla/ipfs-cohost#ipfs-cohost-) is a CLI to co-host websites published to IPFS. If your domain has a DNSlink to a CID, then ipfs-cohost will let others pin it to their IPFS node.
