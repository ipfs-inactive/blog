# Recapping IPFS in Q4 2019 🎉
We’ve put together a very special issue looking back on all that you, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) community, accomplished so far, in 2019. From milestones like releases, projects like ProtoSchool, to the many new (and awesome) contributors who have joined us, and what’s to come for the rest of this year, we hope you enjoy this quarterly recap.

Thanks for being part of our community, we truly couldn’t make IPFS what is without you. ❤️

## Milestones
*As far as shipping goes, yeah we did that.*

### IPFS Browser Update
Read about [the ongoing collaborations with Firefox, Brave, Opera, and other browsers](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-08-ipfs-browsers-update/) we have going on, and learn about our progress so far.

### Loads of IPFS Camp content to catch up on!
From [the keynotes to the developer interviews](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-14-ipfs-camp-keynotes-interviews/), to [the Sci-Fi Fair videos](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-03-ipfs-camp-sci-fi-fair-videos/), there’s a ton of great IPFS Camp videos to watch! 

### js-ipfs 0.39.0 and 0.40.0 released
The js-ipfs team has been hard at work figuring out the foundations to switch to a hash format in the future, and much, much more. Check out the updates from both [version 0.39.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/071-js-ipfs-0-39/) and [0.40.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-12-02-js-ipfs-0-40/). 

### Learn how to use go-ipfs as a library
The title says it all! Learn how to use [go-ipfs as a library](https://blog.ipfs.io/073-go-ipfs-as-a-library/) with the new tutorial and take full advantage of the go-ipfs core API.

### Explore the Files API on ProtoSchool
This new tutorial [explores the methods at the top-level of js-ipfs](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-11-06-explore-the-files-api-on-protoschool/) (add, get, cat, etc.) that are custom-built for working with files. Check it out!

### Presenting on IPFS? We got you
Feel free to [use these materials](https://github.com/ipfs/community#ipfs-event-materials), like How IPFS Works and IPFS Deep Dive Workshops, to make your event(s) awesome!
