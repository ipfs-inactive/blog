## Added support for Nix already in progress
Obsidian Systems is adding support for IPFS to Nix, a package manager, but at its heart a general-purpose build tool, so that build products can be persisted to and fetched from IPFS. Learn how they have organized this work into two distinct phases (Milestone 1 was already achieved!) by reading the announcement.
