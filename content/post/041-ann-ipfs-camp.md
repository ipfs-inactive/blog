The event will build on top of the successful IPFS Developer Meetings in Berlin last year and add a full immersive experience for its attendees and contributors.

Join us on 27-30th June at the beautiful Campus La Mola in Barcelona for an action-packed program of workshops, talks and deep dives on everything IPFS.
