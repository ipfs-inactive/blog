The annual premier hackathon event for the North American Ethereum community, ETHDenver and ColoradoJam, has come to a close. The 2021 event was 100% virtual, utilizing the gaming platform Gamerjibe as a virtual event venue, creating a unique and refreshing way for the dweb community to gather together.

## Event highlights
When it came to building with IPFS, we saw NFT marketplaces, decentralized and off-chain gaming, platforms solving real world issues involving life insurance and genetic testing, and consistently created ways to lower barriers for wallet creation, token creation, and more. 
 * 31 out 86 total projects submitted to ETHDenver applied for IPFS bounties
 * 64 out of 86 projects submitted applied for IPFS-ecosystem tooling bounties (the most popular being Ceramic, Textile and Metamask)
 * The IPFS project awarded bounties to 11 submissions for their creative use of IPFS
 * 32 of the 51 winning projects were award bounties for using IPFS-ecosystem tooling

## The Virtual Castle
Alongside the event Discord, the livestream, and the hacks, ETHDenver also created a virtual venue for attendees to wander around, try on swag, gather collectibles, check out sponsor booths, and hang out as a community.

In lieu of a sponsor booth, the IPFS Help Desk returned! Folks from IPFS, Slate, Fleek, Pinata, Opera, and Foundation all took turns hosting as their digital avatars, even occasionally running into a rainbow Pegabufficorn.
