Greetings InterPlanetary Community!

The InterPlanetary Space Training Camp is over and now that we are all back to Earth, I have the joy of sharing the news and learnings with you.

If you aren't familiar with the [InterPlanetary Space Training Camp](https://camp.ipfs.io/) (IPFS Camp for short), it was a 3 day Hacker retreat for the Builders of the DWeb. Attendees travelled through a [space portal](https://twitter.com/ChrisPacia/status/1144291810874920967) to get to the Space Training Station in another Galaxy (Star coordinates yet undisclosed). Throughout the Camp, attendees had the chance to participate in:

#### [**👩🏽‍🏫 Core & Elective Courses**](https://github.com/ipfs/camp#-core--elective-courses)

### IPFS Camp `Success` is `defined` by the number of `friendships`, `conversations`, `collaborations` and `new projects` that get started.

And it was a blast. Here is a quick video recap as a souvenir for everyone that was there, and a postcard for everyone that didn't get a chance this time around:

[![](img/060-ipfs-camp-recap/ipfs-camp-youtube-preview)](https://youtu.be/kc_dxO-V8YM)

However, the IPFS Camp spirit doesn't stop here, now it is all about continuing the dialog that got started and taking all the learnings and materials to local IPFS Communities, showing and teaching more folks how to build on the P2P Web. All the content produced can be found in the IPFS Camp Repo -- http://github.com/ipfs/camp. We will be posting all the recordings soon as well.

Last, but definitely not the least, a huge THANK YOU ❤️ to everyone that contributed to the event. IPFS Camp wouldn't be possible if it werent for:

- The **160 Attendees** coming from over **22 Countries**!
- The [**67 Content Creators**](https://camp.ipfs.io/team) that produced all the training and talk material for the camp attendees
- An outstanding [Production Team](https://camp.ipfs.io/team) that created the phenomenal experience for everyone
- The over 4000 IPFS Community members that have been building this project with us since the beginning

On behalf of the whole IPFS Project, thank you all for being part of this project and community, such an ambitious goal couldn't be achieved without all your energy, passion and dedication to make it happen. Onwards!

David Dias & The IPFS Team

`Extra:` As a closing gift, here are some random interesting facts about Camp:

- 😸 IPFS Camp was the 1st time the Lazer Cat bot became [**P2P Lazer Cat bot**](https://github.com/gorhgorh/ipfscatremote)
- 🍦 All you can eat fruit ice cream made all attendees very happy.
- 👋🏽 Textile created a [**P2P Tag Game**](https://github.com/textileio/advanced-react-native-boilerplate/blob/ipfs-tag/README.md). I believe the last person to be "it" is still looking for the next person to tag, so look out at future events!
- 👕 The first **SWAG Trading Post** was established, an eco-responsible way of attendees picking the item of swag they love the most or trade for others, avoiding the regular Conference waste and making sure everyone can optimize.
- 📶 The Wifi worked! Well, almost, we are sorry for that one morning hiccup. Thank you everyone (espeically the course trainers!) for coming prepared with ways to make everything work offline and distributed ❤️
- 📦 The **whole NPM was crammed into a box** for the first time, an homage to Jen from the IT Crowd.
- 🔌 The power cut out for a bit, but the Space Training Station continued to operate! Offline first FTW!
- 🤝 Many people organically found and recommended people to find at camp using [The Gathering](https://gthr.io).
- 💻 IPFS Camp content is over **[4200 lines - created through 269 commits from 63 individual Github Accounts](https://github.com/ipfs/camp/pulse/monthly)** - and these numbers keep growing. WOW!
