## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

### Announcing the IPFS Project Q3 Priorities & Working Groups
Earlier this summer, the IPFS team got together to create a plan to make IPFS performant, stable, high quality and updated regularly - and ready to grow even more. [Check out the plan](https://ipfs.io/blog/2019-07-31-operation-task-force/), along with remixed working groups and more!

### Introducing Multiple-Choice Lessons in ProtoSchool
Did you know that not every lesson in ProtoSchool includes a coding challenge? ProtoSchool has long supported both coding exercises and text-based lessons, but today we're introducing [a new lesson type: multiple-choice](https://twitter.com/ProtoSchool/status/1156942749595312128). 🎉

As the author of a tutorial, you can now present the learner with a multiple-choice quiz after she reads the text of your lesson, adding some interactivity and a chance to check comprehension before moving on to the next topic. Learn more about [building ProtoSchool tutorials](https://proto.school/#/build).

### Learn about Supporting Web Archiving via Web Packaging in the 2019-07-29 IPFS Weekly Call
Last week during the IPFS Weekly Call, Sawood Alam was on hand to give a fantastic presentation on Web Packaging and how it can support web archiving. [Check it out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u57MerV0PJM)
