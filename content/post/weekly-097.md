## Brand new on IPFS

* [Bitsearch](https://bitsear.ch/) is a new search engine for the decentralized web by the team from ViewBlock.
* [IPFS x Audius: A story of harmony.](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-07-09-case-study-audius/) Read the first edition of the IPFS Case Study Series.
* The latest version of [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/releases/tag/v2.14.0) just hit the extension stores, and it’s pretty spiffy!
