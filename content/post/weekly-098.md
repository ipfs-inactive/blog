# Welcome to IPFS Weekly #98

Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## Join us Monday for our next monthly meetup
Our next IPFS Virtual Community Meetup is scheduled for Monday, August 3rd and we want you to be there! Join us for some presentations on the latest in IPFS, as well as get a chance to present your work during our [lightning sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1img1dzYQXAvB2D2Z-7UIHwKAxvODxZNsFj9tSjZdqCA/edit)!

## New in the GitHub marketplace: IPFS + GitHub actions
Created by Oli Evans (@olizilla), you can now pin your site to IPFS from a GitHub Action! The action pins a directory to IPFS by using the ipfs-cluster-ctl command to pin it to a remote IPFS Cluster.

[Go start pinning](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-github-action)
