title: Recapping IPFS in Q3 2019 üéâ
author: Jenn Turner
---

Every day brings us closer to the end of 2019! To celebrate, we put together a very special issue looking back on all that the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) community has accomplished so far in 2019. From milestones like remixing our working group and shipping new releases, to the many awesome (and new!) contributors who have joined us, and what‚Äôs to come for the rest of this year, we hope you enjoy this quarterly recap.

Thanks for being part of our community, we truly couldn‚Äôt make IPFS what it is without you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Milestones

## Shipped IPFS Project Q3 Priorities & Working Groups

Back in July, [we remixed the project working groups](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-07-31-operation-task-force/) to include Team Bifrost, Package Managers, and more!

## Project releases galore! 

### js-ipfs 0.37.0 and 0.38.0 released üíõ

[Version 0.37.0 featured](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-06-js-ipfs-0-37/) a new constructor, better DNSLink support and delegated routing, with [version 0.38.0 adding support](https://blog.ipfs.io/070-js-ipfs-0-38/) for garbage collection, Gossipsub, and IPNS support for `ipfs resolve`!

### js-libp2p 0.26.0 released üß©

In early August, [js-libp2p also got Gossipsub support](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-07-js-libp2p-0-26/), and Promisify-ied the libp2p API.

### go-ipfs 0.4.22 released üí†

go-ipfs versions 0.4.19, 0.4.20, and go-ipfs 0.4.21 shipped an unusual number of critical regressions which were fixed with [this most recent patch release](https://blog.ipfs.io/054-go-ipfs-0.4.22).

## go-ipfs improves the IPFS Release Process

The aforementioned regressions necessitated a new approach to the release process, [as detailed this past August](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-14-ipfs-release-process/). The new approach added three specific changes to the 5-stage process.

## You can now pubsub with the JS IPFS HTTP API client in the browser!

Due to boring technical reasons, pubsub over the HTTP API in the browser was not supported. But once the fetch API supported cancelation, [pubsub support with js-ipfs had arrived](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-29-pubsub-in-the-browser/)!

## IPFS Desktop 0.9 released üñ•

In early September, [the newest version of IPFS Desktop, 0.9.2 shipped](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-09-19-ipfs-desktop-0-9/)! You can now browse, use npm on IPFS, add IPFS command line tools to your system, and more!

## IPFS Browser Update 

We aim to have multiple browsers implement fully native (and interoperable!) IPFS support. As part of this progression, we‚Äôve had ongoing collaborations with Firefox, Brave, Opera, and other browsers. [Read on to hear the latest status](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-08-ipfs-browsers-update/) and learn about our progress so far.

## IPFS + ENS Everywhere: Introducing EthDNS (technically in Q4 but we had to share)

Earlier this month, [EthDNS was announced](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ethdns-9d56298fa38a), bridging the traditional web world to the new universe of ENS-named, IPFS-backed decentralized sites and dapps through the ancient, yet indispensable, üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Domain Name System üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# IPFS Camp

True, IPFS Camp took place in Q2, but so much of the amazing content that came out of the event wasn‚Äôt ready for consumption until Q3. Check out these batches of awesome IPFS Camp video and blog content!
