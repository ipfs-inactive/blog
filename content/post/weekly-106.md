Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## An IPFS September to Remember Meetup 
If you missed the latest IPFS Meetup, not to worry. You can catch up on all the presentations, from IPFS Recovery to IoTex to the details behind go-IPFS 0.7 and more, by tuning into the IPFS YouTube channel. Bonus feature: another delightful lightning talk you won’t want to miss!

## Space Race 2: Slingshot - put your project on Filecoin for FIL token rewards!
Following [Space Race 1](https://spacerace.filecoin.io/), a competition for storage miners that resulted in 230PiB onboarded to the Filecoin testnet, Protocol Labs announced Space Race 2: Slingshot, a competition for the community of developers excited to use all this storage! Developers who integrate an application with and store useful data on Filecoin’s testnet can be eligible for potentially large Filecoin token rewards. We’d love to have as many developers from the IPFS community as possible participating - eligible integrations can be as simple as using a tool like [Textile’s Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/) to back up data your project is already storing on IPFS to Filecoin. Competition details can be found [here](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-sr2-slingshot/)!

## New IPFS Case Study: Arbol
Continuing the IPFS Case Study Series, Arbol is the latest organization to be featured, discussing how IPFS has benefitted their agriculturally-focused platform. From creating contracts for parametric weather protection agreements to the role of content addressability, Arbol has a very interesting case.
