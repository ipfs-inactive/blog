If you've spent time in the web3 ecosystem, you've probably come across work that was supported by a grant from the IPFS team. The [ENS integration work we funded in 2019](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ethdns-9d56298fa38a) established a de facto standard for [decentralized website hosting](https://app.ens.domains/name/ethereum.eth). A 2018 (?) grant to PeerGos TK.  TK other examples (ADD ME!).

The variety and vitality of projects at [IPFS Camp](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-07-08-ipfs-camp-recap/) blew us away, but even more significant was the palpable need for "middle layer" (FIXME: placeholder term, open to suggestions) tools: functionality that doesn't quite belong in IPFS core, but still spans multiple projects. Helping the community coordinate and fund production of these public goods felt like the perfect job for an expanded, transparent, and open version of our grant program: we call it the IPFS Grant *Platform*, because it's intended to bring together community members at every stage of the grant-making and grant-writing process.

We soft launched in Q1, with the trial cohort [focusing](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/FOCUS.md#q1-2020-hello-world) on the core proposition: empowering the community to meet shared needs. The cohort projects range from [small exploratory grants to community networks exploring using dweb technlogies to provide local services](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/issues/11), to [improved representations of Unix files](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6920) needed by [package managers](https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers), to [an ambitious novel IPFS implementation](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/tree/master/open-grants/ipfs-rust) that will be relied on by many projects.

This batch has already borne fruit, including [half a dozen completed bounties](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/projects/1), the beginnings of a [Rust IPFS implementation](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipfs), [pioneering user research](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-10-ipfs-mobile-design-research/), and more. It also happened to coincide with the spread of the worst pandemic the modern world has known.

Therefore, we're making two announcements:

* **We're officially launching the IPFS Grants Platform.** Hop over to the [repo](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants) to learn more. We'll be following up soon with IPFS Grants Guide here on the blog, with a deep dive into the different grant types and participation HOWTO.
* **The Q2 [Quarterly Focus](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/FOCUS.md) is COVID relief.** This includes things like making COVID related datasets [more durable and available](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster/issues/1021), enabling community support networks, empowering remote work during quarantine, and so on. Proposals addressing these issues will be given first consideration.

We couldn't have put this program together without your support and guidance: 

- PL's very own dev grant programs operated by the [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/devgrants) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/grants/) teams
- [COVID-19 Open Innovation Grants](https://protocollabs.smapply.io/prog/covid-19_open_innovation_grants/) from Protocol Labs Research
- [Secure Scuttlebut Consoritum](https://github.com/ssbc/grants-process) as an example of low overhead, high autonomy grants
- [Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support](https://ecosystem.support/) and [web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/grants/)
- everyone who participated in the Q1 cohort and helped us dial in the application flow
