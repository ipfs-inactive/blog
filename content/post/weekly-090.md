# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here’s what’s happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! 🚀

## The path to decentralization and go-ipfs 0.5 on the Zero Knowledge Podcast
IPFS Project Lead Molly Mackinlay was recently a guest on the [Zero Knowledge Podcast](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/129) talk about her experience guiding the IPFS project, as well as libp2p, Bitswap, Testground, the use cases and projects working with these tools, and the specific upgrades made with the recent 0.5 IPFS release. Enjoy!

## Experience the IPFS Pinning Summit, again!
True, the IPFS Pinning Summit has come and gone, but if you missed it, we have you covered.
