## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

+ Did you know there’s an [IPFS Weekly Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#-ipfs-weekly-call--formerly-known-as-ipfs-all-hands-call)? Mondays at 5pm, UTC join IPFS contributors around the globe for a face to face meeting that also features one or more short talks from guest presenters! Next week, December 3, presenter Jacob Heun will talk about the recent JS-Libp2p release, and the week after that Sander Pick will share about Textile photos. Check out the [IPFS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC) for more dates and info!
+ If you are newer to tech but passionate about decentralization you should apply for the [IT Engineer role](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/6f389ca4-3c43-44a5-8695-63f7b023ecb2) at Protocol Labs. It’s a remote position helping empower the team working on IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more!
