## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

## Meet Matt Ober 😸

[Matt Ober](https://twitter.com/MattOber1) comes from Omaha, Nebraska, where he spends most of his days coding everything that goes into [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/), a pinning service for the IPFS ecosystem. Pinata makes managing content on IPFS easy through a variety of tools and API endpoints. When Matt isn’t developing Pinata, he’s usually hanging out with his dog Winston or trying out some random dinner recipe he found on the internet.
