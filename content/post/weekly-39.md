## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. üëã

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that‚Äôs a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we‚Äôre up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.


## The latest

### go-ipfs 0.4.20 released
Highlights from the latest release of the Go implementation, go-ipfs, include support for Docker commands, a major WebUI release, some improved *and* new commands, plus perf and reliability improvements. Read the full release notes on [the IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/83-go-ipfs-0-4-20/).


### Introducing IPFS-lite: embeddable, lightweight IPFS-network peer for IPLD applications
Last week, Hector Sanjuan shared [IPFS-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite), an embeddable, lightweight IPFS-network peer for IPLD applications. It allows to ipfs-ify any libp2p application but also to run lightweight embedded peers that can read and write files to IPFS but not do all the other things. [Read more about IPFS-lite](
https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/ipfs-lite-embeddable-lightweight-ipfs-network-peer-for-ipld-applications/5237).


### go-ds-crdt: A distributed key-value store implementation for IPFS
[go-ds-crdt](https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/go-ds-crdt-a-distributed-key-value-store-implementation-for-ipfs/5239) is the new datastore backend for the IPFS Cluster shared state. go-ds-crdt provides a distributed key-value store using CRDTs and implements the Datastore interface. The idea is that any datastore can now be replaced by a replicated datastore. [Read more about go-ds-crdt](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-crdt).


### Storage Driver: Add an IPFS driver
Earlier this week, Docker received [a pull request](https://github.com/docker/distribution/pull/2906) to add an IPFS storage driver to the Docker registry. The pr would allow for a swarm of Docker registries to share an underlying, content-addressed storage layer out of the box. Pretty exciting stuff!


## Meet Pedro Santos, developer of Discussify

Next week, [the IPFS Weekly call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt#-ipfs-weekly-call--formerly-known-as-ipfs-all-hands-call) welcomes [Pedro Santos](https://github.com/pedromiguelss), a front-end developer holding Advanced Studies (3rd cycle) in Informatics Engineering (having already completed his first year in the Doctoral Program in Informatics Engineering). Pedro graduated in Computer Engineering from the Integrated Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering, at the Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto (FEUP). Pedro is joining the weekly call to present a walkthrough on [IPFS and Discussify‚Äôs browser extension app](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/discussify-browser-extension). Don‚Äôt miss it!
