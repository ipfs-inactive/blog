## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

## IPFS Camp Highlights

If you missed the first ever IPFS Camp, not to worry! We’ll be releasing videos and content from the 4-day event to catch you up. But first, we wanted to share [this amazing recap of the event](https://medium.com/textileio/ipfs-camp-2019-the-highlights-and-takeaways-2b3cb4f42513) from Andrew Hill of [Textile](https://textile.io/) (seriously where did you get the energy to do this??). Andrew created an excellent highlight piece, complete with photos, links to projects and code, and summaries of crucial discussions and themes throughout. Thanks for putting this fantastic recap piece together, Andrew!
