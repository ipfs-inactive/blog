## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we’re up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

+ We’re excited to announce the inaugural **IPFS Camp**, a three-day hacker retreat for the creators and builders of the distributed web. Join us on June 27-20th at the amazing Campus La Mola in Barcelona for an action-packed program of workshops, talks and deep dives on everything IPFS. More information, including registration, will be available on the [IPFS blog soon](https://blog.ipfs.io/)! 
+ [IPFS Cluster version 0.9.0](https://cluster.ipfs.io/news/0.9.0_release/) comes with one big new feature, OpenCensus support! Happy Measured Pinning!
+ Last week, the IPFS research team released a paper on [Merkle-CRDTs](https://github.com/ipfs/research-CRDT/issues/45), that is, CRDTs backed by Merkle-DAGs. The paper formalizes what the team calls a Merkle-Clock (a logical clock) and goes on to describe Merkle-CRDTs as CRDTs on Merkle-Clocks.
+ Introducing [IPFS Stash](https://medium.com/twos-complement/ipfs-stash-local-ipfs-for-everyone-ethdenver2019-b5b45ae0d5c9) — Local IPFS for everyone created during #ETHDenver2019.
