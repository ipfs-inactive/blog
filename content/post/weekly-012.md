# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. üëã

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that‚Äôs a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Looking to get involved? Click on some of the links below, see what we‚Äôre up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs), or join us on [IRC](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ipfs:matrix.org).

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.

## The latest

The best part? Their content is streamed via a p2p app called [the Lab](https://lab.paratii.video). The Lab is a repository for high-quality crypto content that doesn‚Äôt spy on you and relies on IPFS. It‚Äôs also is open source and you can distribute the series yourself through embedding.
