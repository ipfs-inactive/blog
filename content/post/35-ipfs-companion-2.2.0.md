title: IPFS Companion 2.2.0 brings window.ipfs to your Browser
author: lidel

I am pleased to announce to everyone in our community that a new version of our
browser extension has been released!

![demo of v2.2.0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/38491868-6c9dbaa0-3bed-11e8-975a-52bea908f1cb.gif)

Why is it worth a blog post you ask? See the overview of key features below.

# 🔦 Highlights

### Your node is exposed as `window.ipfs` on every webpage

Websites can now detect if the property exists in window context and opt-in to
use it instead of creating their own js-ipfs node.  It saves system resources
and battery (on mobile), avoids the overhead of peer discovery/connection,
enables shared repository access and more!

</p>

Make sure to read our [notes on exposing IPFS API as window.ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/window.ipfs.md),
where we explain it in-depth and provide examples on how to use it your own dapp.

### Embedded js-ipfs Node

The Browser Action menu provides a toggle for switching  between external IPFS
node accessed over HTTP API and embedded, in-memory instance of js-ipfs.

The embedded node is great for quickly sharing files with someone, or for
testing a dapp that uses `window.ipfs` without having to install and start up
your own IPFS daemon.
Power users can provide own config (eg. to enable experimental pubsub) via _Preferences_.

**Note:** The embedded node _does not run_ when external node is selected.
Every time you switch back to the embedded node, a new instance is created
on-demand. It can take [a few seconds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/38493690-4a77bd9e-3bf3-11e8-85da-ba06fd94cdbf.gif)
for a brand-new node to find peers.
