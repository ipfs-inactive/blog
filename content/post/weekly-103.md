# Welcome to IPFS Weekly #103

Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## Peergos wins EU Next Generation Internet grant
Many congratulations to the folks at Peergos for their recent award of a €200,000 grant by the Next Generation Internet Program for Open Internet Renovation (NGI-POINTER). They intend to use the opportunity to develop new and exciting features for Peergos that will see it evolve into a privacy-focused, decentralized social network. Excellent work, friends! 👏

## Please upgrade go and go-libp2p immediately
🚨 Ring the alarm! 🚨 Users of go-libp2p need to: 

upgrade their go installations to v1.14.7 and v1.13.15 —and—
upgrade their go-libp2p-* dependencies to the latest released versions
in order to secure their applications against an upstream security vulnerability.
