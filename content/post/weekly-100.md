# Welcome to IPFS Weekly #100

Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! 🚀

## 🚨 We are deprecating SECIO very soon 🚨
Soon, support for the SECIO security transport in IPFS and libp2p will be removed. You can mitigate impact to your node(s) by updating to the latest versions.

A one day conference about Randomness Beacons: the research done, the current use-cases and challenges and the systems available, all taking place this week! Speakers include Juan Benet, Vitalik Buterin, Justin Drake and others, and the event is free to attend.

## How content addressing solves streaming challenges 
Research plays a crucial role in IPFS development and iteration and that’s why we’re happy to share this recent post from Yiannis Psaras on the merits of content addressability in a world increasingly reliant on internet networks.

## Brand new on IPFS
* The latest release of [Peergos v0.3.0](https://peergos.org/posts/release-v0.3.0), gives a huge range of new features, speed ups, and fixes. 
* [Introducing Space](https://blog.space.storage/posts/Introducing-Space), an open-source file storage, sharing and collaboration platform for the dweb, from Fleek.
* [Testground v0.5.3](https://github.com/testground/testground/releases/tag/v0.5.3) adds support for traffic routing policies, basic authentication support, and more.
* [The React Roundup podcast](https://devchat.tv/react-round-up/rru-114-decentralized-react-threadsdb-ipfs-filecoin-with-carson-farmer/) had Carson Farmer from Textile on to talk ThreadsDB, IPFS, and more.

## New IPFS case study: OpenBazaar
The second in the IPFS Case Study Series focuses on OpenBazaar, a p2p e-commerce platform where buyers and sellers can participate anonymously and privately. By using IPFS to create this collaborative network, OpenBazaar enables users to trade without the risks of centralized data collection or the threat of having their personal information hacked!

## HackFS + IPFS = 🤯
From COVID-19 tracing to crowdfunding on the dweb to a social distancing lyrics app, a PiedPiper mockup and more—you have to check out the cool things folks built with IPFS during HackFS.
