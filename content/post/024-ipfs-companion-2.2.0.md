title: IPFS Companion 2.2.0 brings window.ipfs to your Browser
author: lidel
---

We are pleased to announce to everyone in our community that a new version of our
browser extension has been released!

![demo of v2.2.0](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdJTmCxwcpoGbEVfT6b9j4RZJWNcF2GQG1Ajf9XB6XtVP)

# ðŸ”¦ Highlights

### Your node is exposed as `window.ipfs` on every webpage

The API aims to be compatible with [interface-ipfs-core](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/),
which means websites can now detect if the property exists in window context
and opt-in to use it instead of creating their own [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) node.
It saves system resources and battery (on mobile), avoids the overhead of peer
discovery/connection, enables shared repository access and more!

Make sure to read our [notes on exposing IPFS API as window.ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/window.ipfs.md),
where we explain it in-depth and provide examples on how to use it your own dapp.

You can also play with simple demo apps that take advantage of `window.ipfs`:

- [IPFS Peer Map](https://github.com/tableflip/ipfs-peer-map-example) provides a visualization of `ipfs.swarm.peers`
- [PeerID-to-QRCode](https://github.com/hacdias/ipfs-id-qr-codes) creates QR Codes based on `ipfs.id`
- and obligatory [TODO App](https://github.com/hacdias/ipfs-todo), uses `ipfs.files` for storage

### Embedded js-ipfs Node

The Browser Action menu provides a toggle for switching  between external IPFS
node accessed over HTTP API and embedded, in-memory instance of js-ipfs.

The embedded node is great for quickly sharing files with someone, or for
testing a dapp that uses `window.ipfs` without having to install and start up
your own IPFS daemon.
Power users can provide own config (eg. to enable experimental pubsub) via _Preferences_.

**Note:** The embedded node _does not run_ when external node is selected.
Every time you switch back to the embedded node, a new instance is created
on-demand. It can take [a few seconds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/38493690-4a77bd9e-3bf3-11e8-85da-ba06fd94cdbf.gif)
for a brand-new node to find peers.
