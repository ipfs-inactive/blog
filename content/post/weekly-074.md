## Project updates

* Qri shipped [a new docs page](https://qri.io/docs/) üéâ
* Peergos asks what would [the perfect social network look like](https://peergos.org/posts/perfect-social-network)?  
* [Cyber](https://cyber.page/) is a consensus computer on top of IPFS that uses IPFS hashes to create cyberlinks. In other words, it is a decentralized search engine built with the help of IPFS. They have recently released their testnet: [Euler-5](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/releases). It is an incentivized testnet that allows launching validator nodes, searching for content on IPFS and most importantly create cyberlinks (semantically link IPFS hashes to create a semantic core).

## Win the Decentralized Future Prize

Nesta is launching an [open call for essays](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/decentralised-future-prize/) that explore how the next decade of decentralization could change the way we work together towards shared goals, how we structure organizations and the societal impacts of these changes. We want these essays to inform policymakers and the public about the potential of these new technologies and inspire a new wave of innovators to experiment with different organizational structures for social good. The writer of the best essay will secure a ¬£3,000 prize; to enter, you‚Äôll need to send us a short written pitch for your essay (500 words max) by Sunday 26th January.

## Work in progress

* Coming soon: the js-ipfs async-await refactor. It‚Äôs currently closer than it‚Äôs ever been to being done.
* Can you write great docs? There‚Äôs never been a better time to help the global IPFS community by [contributing to our new docs beta site](https://docs.ipfs.io/project/contribute/#documentation)! 
* [gomobile-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api/pull/202) is almost ready!
