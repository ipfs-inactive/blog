## Editing

## Install

1. [Install node + npm](https://iojs.org/) and required modules.

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run build.

```sh
node build.js
```

## Usage

### Creating a Post

To create a new post:

```sh
cp -r drafts/post-draft-template drafts/<short-title>
cd drafts/<short-title>
# edit index.md
# edit skeleton.md
rm skeleton-template.md
```

That will create a directory for the post inside `drafts/`. Edit the `index.md` and `skeleton.md` there. Place any static assets (e.g. images) inside that directory.

When ready to publish, the post directory will be moved from `drafts/` into `src/`, with be given the next sequential number.


### Live editing

Run build:

```
make build
```

This should setup a server. For now, it screws up the styling because the styles are pulled from ipfs directly. (FIXME, should put the styles in the build dir.) Just kill it when you're ready to publish

### Theme

The layouts follow [the example viewer](https://github.com/ipfs/examples/tree/master/webapps/example-viewer). Modify the files inside

```
tmpl/
```

## Publishing Post

How to publish the blog on IPFS.io.

### Editing

1. Make a change to a file
2. Add and commit.
3. `make build`
4. `$ ipfs add -r build`
  Only if you want a preview for other people (you can just use `make serve`). The path is `build`, in the website and the blog.
  The daemon needs to be running for others to access it, or to access it through a gateway.
5. Push to remote branch.
6. Make a pull request to `master`.
7. Get it merged following review from _another_ member.
8. `$ git checkout master && git pull origin master`

### Publishing

7. `$ ipfs daemon`
8. `$ make publish`
  Now anyone who has the hash can access.
10. Go to IRC: Use pinbot to liase with all of the other 8 gateways (planets: Uranus, Venus, etc) and make sure they have it pinned. So, like so:

      `$ !pin <hash> <label>`

  The label (it should be `blog`) can change, of course. This can sometimes take ages, because there is a pinbug that causes a hang. Pinbot will tell you when it succeeds. If it continually hangs, the gateway needs to restart. Pin @lgierth or @whyrusleeping and tell them that the pinning bug is bugging you, and have them zap it. Then try pinning again (it should work right away).

11. `$ make publish-to-domain`

You will need access to DigitalOcean for this to work. You will then need to use the token. This will take a few minutes for DNS to propogate.
