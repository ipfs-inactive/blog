## Editing

## Install

1. [Install node + npm](http://nodejs.org) and required modules.
2. [Install hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run build.

```sh
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Creating a Post

To create a new post:

```sh
cp -r drafts/post-draft-template drafts/<short-title>
cd drafts/<short-title>
# edit index.md
# edit skeleton.md
rm skeleton-template.md
```

That will create a directory for the post inside `drafts/`. Edit the `index.md` and `skeleton.md` there. Place any static assets (e.g. images) inside that directory.

When ready to publish, the post directory will be moved from `drafts/` into `src/`, with be given the next sequential number.


### Live editing

Start a live reloading hugo:

```
npm start
```

Blog should not be available at http://localhost:1313/blog/

### Theme

The layouts follow [the example viewer](https://github.com/ipfs/examples/tree/master/webapps/example-viewer). Modify the files inside

```
layouts/
static/
```

## Publishing Post

How to publish the blog on IPFS.io.

### Editing

1. Make a change to a file
2. Add and commit.
3. `make build`
4. `$ ipfs add -r build`
  Only if you want a preview for other people (you can just use `make serve`). The path is `build`, in the website and the blog.
  The daemon needs to be running for others to access it, or to access it through a gateway.
5. Push to remote branch.
6. Make a pull request to `master`.
7. Get it merged following review from _another_ member.
8. `$ git checkout master && git pull origin master`

### Publishing

7. `$ ipfs daemon`
8. `$ make publish`
  Now anyone who has the hash can access.
10. Go to IRC: Use pinbot to liase with all of the other 8 gateways (planets: Uranus, Venus, etc) and make sure they have it pinned. So, like so:

      `$ !pin <hash> <label>`

  The label (it should be `blog`) can change, of course. This can sometimes take ages, because there is a pinbug that causes a hang. Pinbot will tell you when it succeeds. If it continually hangs, the gateway needs to restart. Pin @lgierth or @whyrusleeping and tell them that the pinning bug is bugging you, and have them zap it. Then try pinning again (it should work right away).

11. `$ make publish-to-domain`

You will need access to DigitalOcean for this to work. You will then need to use the token. This will take a few minutes for DNS to propogate.
